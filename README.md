## Introduction
IMDb is a website that contains information on thousands of movies and shows that have been released over the years. Each movie or show has its own description and genre to go along with it. Through the perspective of someone who make’s their own movie or show, you would want to adequately create a description that captures the genre of your work. The importance of this subject matter is that if a movie’s genre is labeled appropriately, it would gain the attraction of viewers who are interested in that particular genre. However, if a movie is labeled inappropriately, it may throw off a viewer who watches a movie thinking its of a particular genre, but instead was something that they are not interested in. Predicting the genre of a movie/show using the description is the core of the problem that I will be trying to solve in this report. From this point forward in the report, I will calling every data entry (movies and shows) in the dataset as ‘movie’ for the sake of simplicity.
